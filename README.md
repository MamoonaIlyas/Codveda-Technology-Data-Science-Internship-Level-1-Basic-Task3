Task 3: Exploratory Data  Analysis (EDA).
📊 Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Internship Level: Level 1 (TASK 3)
Organization: Codveda Technologies
Domain: Data Science
Dataset Used: Boston Housing Dataset

🔍 Objective:
The goal of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the structure, patterns, and relationships within the dataset before building predictive models.

🧠 Key Activities:
✅ Computed summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and variance for key numerical features.

✅ Created various data visualizations including:

Histograms to understand feature distributions

Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables

Box plots to detect outliers and analyze value ranges

✅ Developed a correlation heatmap to identify relationships and potential multicollinearity between features.

✅ Compiled an insights report based on the patterns, distributions, correlations, and anomalies found in the dataset.

📌 Insights Highlight:
Features like 'RM' and 'LSTAT' are strongly correlated with the target variable 'MEDV'.

Several features such as 'CRIM' and 'ZN' are highly skewed and contain outliers.

Multicollinearity exists among features like 'TAX' and 'RAD', which could impact certain models.

🛠 Tools & Libraries:
Python

Pandas

NumPy
